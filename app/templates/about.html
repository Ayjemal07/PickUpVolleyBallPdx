            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>This group was founded in spring 2021 on the heels of COVID-19 with the goal of providing a welcoming community when people needed it.</p>

            <blockquote>
                The original inclusion statement has remained the same through the years: 
                <strong>“Everyone is welcome at these events. The ONLY exception are those opposed to playing with people of all race, religion, gender, orientation, background, age, and skill level.”</strong>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The culture of inclusivity is one of the things that sets this group apart. You can expect to be welcomed and supported by your fellow players.</p>
